This is the UI for hand-held devices

On the hand-held device, connect to WI-FI, enter a port number of your choice, and click connect.
Then on the server app on the toy car, enter the same port you have chosen and click connect.

On the hand-held device, there are 4 arrows, where each arrow corresponds to one of the GPPOs for one of the 4 wheels.

Once the client and server apps are connected via WI-FI, press the arrow buttons to alter the current (from 1 to 0, or 0 to 1) on the GPPO controling the corresponding wheel, to make it spin forward or backward.
